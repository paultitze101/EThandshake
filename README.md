This project stems from my interest in the mathematics and protocol theory of how a human made AI enabled interstellar probe would do a handshake communication learning protocol to a potential alien probe or ETI via radio, 
light or other signals that it may encounter in its voyages through interstellar space and how this would be implemented via Python code into the onboard AI computer system. The chances of one of our 
interstellar probes making contact with an alien probe or ETI is extremely low in our interstellar neighbourhood hence this is an interest from an academic point of view.
