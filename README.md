This project stems from my interest in the mathematics and protocol theory of how a human made AI enabled interstellar probe would do a handshake communication learning protocol to a potential alien probe or ETI via radio, 
light or other signals that it may encounter in its voyages through interstellar space and how this would be implemented via Python code into the onboard AI computer system. The chances of one of our 
interstellar probes making contact with an alien probe or ETI is extremely low in our interstellar neighbourhood hence this is an interest from an academic point of view.

How would a human made interstellar probe with AI onboard communicate with an alien probe or ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (ETI)?

According to Google Gemini AI:

Since an interstellar encounter would involve vast distances and potentially completely different technologies, communication between a human-made probe with AI and an alien probe would likely be a complex process. Here are some possibilities:

1. Universal Language of Mathematics:
Both probes could transmit fundamental mathematical concepts like prime numbers or geometric theorems. These are universal truths and wouldn't rely on shared understanding of symbols.

2. Shared Astronomical Data:
They could transmit information about known pulsars, specific stars, or even the properties of the Milky Way itself. This establishes a common ground and demonstrates the ability to observe the universe.

3. Simple Symbolic Language:
The probes might build a basic communication system using symbols representing simple concepts like size, shape, origin, and intention. This could gradually evolve into a more complex language.

4. Utilizing the AI:
The AI on the human probe could analyze the alien probe's transmissions (radio waves, light pulses, etc.) for patterns and repetitions. It might then attempt to build a rudimentary understanding of the alien communication system.

5. Patience and Trial and Error:
The process would likely be slow and involve a lot of trial and error. Both probes would need to be programmed to be patient and persistent in their attempts to decipher each other's signals.
The vastness of space and the potential for completely different technological advancements make true "conversation" a challenge. However, the methods above offer a glimpse into how these probes might attempt to establish a basic understanding and initiate communication.
